# NgWeather

An app that showcases how to build a simple app with Angular (running on 14.x)

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli).

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Custom Build Command for GitHub Pages Deployment

Run `ng build --output-path docs --base-href /ng-weather/`. This command is specifically tailored for deploying the Angular application to GitHub Pages.

`--output-path docs`: Outputs the build files to the docs/ directory, which GitHub Pages can serve directly.

`--base-href /ng-weather/`: Sets the base URL for the application, ensuring that all relative links work correctly when the site is hosted at https://<your-username>.github.io/ng-weather/.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive/pipe/service/class/module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
Before running the tests make sure you are serving the app via `ng serve`.
